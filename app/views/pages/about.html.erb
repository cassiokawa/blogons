    <h1>Hey, I'm Cassio Kawakita</h1>
    <p>Welcome to week 2 of my 12 Web Apps in 12 Weeks Challenge.</p>
    <p>This week I built a blog in Rails 4. You're actually on the demo application right now. Cool stuff, right!.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to follow along as I learn more Ruby on Rails, find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/cassiokawa">@Cassio Kawakita</a> or on the web at <a href="http://www.sanpresent.com">mackenziechild.me</a>, and get my posts and exclusive content in your inbox by signing up for my newsletter <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
